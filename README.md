# üëã Hi, I'm Amarjit Bhatia

**Senior Principal Engineer | Electrical Hardware Design | Technical Program Manager | New Product Introduction and Quality Manager**

üîß I‚Äôm a seasoned, cross-functional engineering leader with over two decades of experience delivering complex hardware & system solutions across global markets. I bring a rare blend of deep technical fluency, disciplined program management, and a quality-first mindset. My strength lies in connecting the dots, from design & development to manufacturing & customer impact, ensuring that innovation scales with precision & reliability

üåç I‚Äôve successfully launched multiple platforms through NPI, led cross-functional teams across continents, & navigated the challenges of global supply chains, regulatory compliance, & cost optimization. A recent highlight includes spearheading a companywide UI hardware redesign, resulting in $15M in cross-portfolio savings & improved manufacturability.

I have led Electrical Hardware R&D teams & managed global sustaining & quality engineering functions. 
I developed metrics to track field & factory performance data, guiding root-cause resolution efforts that resulted in a 20% reduction in warranty costs & improved customer satisfaction. I champion data-driven decision-making, leveraging KPIs, dashboards, & retrospectives to drive operational excellence.

I thrive at the intersection of engineering, execution, & strategy, collaborating with multidisciplinary teams spanning electrical, mechanical, firmware, software, & manufacturing engineering. I‚Äôm fluent in both agile & waterfall development, & equally comfortable troubleshooting technical issues, aligning executives, or managing key suppliers.
